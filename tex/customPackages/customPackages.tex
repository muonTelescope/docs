\section{Custom Packages}
Several custom node.js packages need to be created to interface with the hardware. These are kept seperately and added via npm dependencies. They are written in javascript and designed to work with the raspberry pi. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/muonTelescope/coincidence}{\emph{Coincidence}} - Counts number of interupts per given time period. This is used to read both the single channel and coincidence counts.
  \item \href{https://github.com/Sawaiz/mpl3115a2}{\emph{NXP MPL3115A2}} - Pressure and temprature sensor.
  \item \href{https://github.com/Sawaiz/sht3x}{\emph{Sensirion SHT3x}} - Temprature and humididty sensor.
  \item \href{https://github.com/muonTelescope/mppc-interface}{\emph{MPPC Interface}} - Sends and recives voltage, temprature, target voltage and test led data.
  \item \href{https://github.com/muonTelescope/neo6m}{\emph{uBLOX NEO6M}} - GPS module with dead reckoning.
\end{itemize}
